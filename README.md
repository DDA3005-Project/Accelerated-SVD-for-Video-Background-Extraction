# Project
This is the project for DDA3005
## Prob1
Update the naive code for prob1_1, this py can change any matrix to bidiagonal form.
Update the naaive code for prob1_3, this file can calculate the SVD for the squre matrix after bidiagonalization. How to change the SVD of B to A is stil an issue that need to be discussed.
