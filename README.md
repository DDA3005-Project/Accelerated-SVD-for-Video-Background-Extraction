# Project
This is the project for DDA3005
## Prob1
Update the naive code for prob1_1, this py can change any matrix to bidiagonal form.
Update the naive code for prob1_3, this file can calculate the SVD for the squre matrix after bidiagonalization. 

Prob1_3 still need to imporve the performance of the accelerrated Cholesky, by avioding using append, diagonal, etc. Try to finish the algorithm by only changing values instead of creating new list.
